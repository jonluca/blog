Clubhouse is an audio-based social media app, allowing users to join in with group phone calls and discussions with people they follow. Users can dip in and out of these phone calls, known as "rooms" at any time, and choose to either listen in to conversations that are happening or contribute. (c/o The National)[^1]

I recently had a chance to play around with their app, and wanted to try and reverse it. I fired up BurpSuite and installed the root CA on the iPhone, and had access pretty quickly. Fortunately the app didn't try and obfuscate it's API, or even implement any form of certificate stapling, which made querying all the routes pretty straight forward.

## Who's on Clubhouse?

As of 7/12/2020, there are **4943** accounts. The first account was created on 3/17/2020.

## How fast is it growing?

{% include image.html file="clubhouse_growth_rate" alt="Clubhouse Growth Rate" footnote="Clubhouse growth rate, total number of accounts by day" %}

Clubhouse has seen fairly linear growth since April, which implies the founders are trying to keep a pretty standard growth rate, despite an exponential amount of interest.

## How many people are joining per day?

## What are the follower distribution counts?

Most people on Clubhouse have less than 25 followers - 2586 of the 4943 accounts, or \~52% of all users. \~23% of all users have 0 followers.

The distribution of user follower counts follows a fairly typical power law distribution.

Removing the 0 follower count users for visibility, the graph looks like this:

## Who are the most followed people on Clubhouse?

Unsurprisingly the top two users are the founders. After that, a list of partners at various VC firms, founders, and twitter personas make the list. Here are the Top 25, and their respective handles.
