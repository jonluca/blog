<i>This is the second part of a two part series on modern testing infrastructure and methodologies. <a href="/posts/experiments-and-growth-hacking">Part one can be found here. Make sure to read part 1 before continuing.</a></i>

It's now been about 4 months since I published part 1, and I recognize now that publishing part 1 before part 2 was finished was an error. The post got more popular than I was anticipating, and a few of the companies I mentioned actually went through and fixed their testing infrastructure, so I was no longer able to get a lot of interesting information.
