Ryanair is a wonderful example of two extremes - it's one of the worst possible airlines that nickel and dimes you for everything, [it's not
a great employer](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/ryanair-strike-pilots-uk-ireland-flights-cancelled-why-latest-a8454161.html),
and it is rated [the worst European airline](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/worst-airline-which-ryanair-british-airways-survey-vueling-jet2-norwegian-united-singapore-airlines-a8113616.html);
however, it's **dirt** cheap.

Some friends and I wanted to take a trip out of Venice right before Christmas. We did not want to do a single round trip, though - we wanted to do a multi leg journey. The problem with Ryanair's site, however, is that it only lets you make a single round trip itinerary. This is great for round trip flights to a single destination, but means that it's a significant amount of work to cross reference which city goes where. If my flight plan is Airport A -> Airport B -> Airport C -> Airport A there's no way to check that B -> C -> A is a valid journey without checking _both_ the B -> C segment and the C -> A segment.

For instance, our first thought was to go to Berlin. Great - Ryanair has a nonstop from Venice Treviso to Berlin Schönefeld. If we want to add another leg of the trip, which _then_ proceeds to return to Venice Treviso, we'd need to manually go through each of the airports that Berlin flies to and see if _that_ airport flew to Venice.

We could model the relationship between airports as a graph, and then look for a cycle in the graph of size 3, with two nodes we already know.

The first step was to actually get the data from their site.

## Inspecting their site

I was hoping for an `XHR` request that retrieved a full list of airports in JSON format. Unfortunately I wasn't that lucky, but I got close enough. The HTML contained a lot of `ng-` attributes, so I knew it was an angular app. Angular will store all variables in the state of a node, so I could just extract it from there.

The front end clearly did some sort of filtering - if you selected a departure airport it would only show you available destinations. I thought I could just find the node's state and extract it from there.

<p className={"footnote"}>Ryanair only shows you available destinations from your airport of choice</p>

I started poking through devtools, using `angular` to inspect various nodes' state. In the HTML for the destination picker there was a normal `ng-repeat` that iterated over a local variable `allAirportsList` in a `destinationPicker` object.

<p className={"footnote"}>There was a coreList state variable</p>

I traversed down the state tree until I found the `allAirportsList` property, which contained all the airport keys and the locations to which they flew. I extracted this state (over 1MB of route information) and could now build a graph representation of airport connections.

## Building out a graph model

First I had to store the information in a method that would be easily parsed and converted into a graph. The easiest would be to just have a map in which every key (an airport IATA code) was a set of all the airports that it could fly to.

```js
let mappings = {};
let airportCodes = [];
for (const airport of airports.allAirportsList) {
  let id = airport.id; //format airport:XYZ
  let ryanairId = id.split(":");
  if (ryanairId[0] === "airport") {
    let iata = ryanairId[1];
    airportCodes.push(iata);
    if (!mappings.hasOwnProperty(iata)) {
      mappings[iata] = new Set();
    }
    let routes = airport.routes.filter((entry) => {
      return entry.startsWith("airport");
    });

    routes = routes.map((entry) => entry.split(":")[1]); // Format airport:XYZ
    routes = routes.map((entry) => entry.split("|")[0]); // Some airports have format airport:XYZ|XYZ City
    for (const route of routes) {
      mappings[iata].add(route);
    }
  }
}
```

I'm not sure if this is a bidirectional graph - I don't know if Airport A flying to Airport B means that Airport B also flies to Airport A. For now I'll keep this as a directed graph.

I decided to use [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) to visualize the results, as I'd used the library before. This visualization will help in the final graph, as it will show all the valid airports.

## Conclusion

This was the first time I've used a graph algorithm in a non-academic context, which is pretty cool. It was a fun endeavour that created a tool that will hopefully be useful to some. If you're looking to plan a super cheap European vacation you can just use this to add all the legs of your Ryanair flights!

A nice future addition would be to somehow get price data for each flight plan. I found their API and it's pretty straight forward:

```bash
curl 'https://api.ryanair.com/farefinder/3/oneWayFares?&departureAirportIataCode=TSF&language=en&limit=16&market=en-gb&offset=0&outboundDepartureDateFrom=2018-10-04&outboundDepartureDateTo=2019-10-26&priceValueTo=150'
```

I might get to that if I find that our N-length trip gets too expensive.

Also I apologize if this webpage was slow or clunky - normally I'm a [huge fan of web optimizations](https://hackernoon.com/optimizing-a-static-site-d5ab6899f249), but this blog post needed libraries that are significantly slower than average to show what I wanted to show[^2].

[^1]: This graph is actually a more limited version of the problem - since every airport flies to TSF, we are artificially limiting the number of routes. Let's say that A, B, and C are in the graph that fly to TSF. Airport D does not fly to TSF, but it does fly to airport A, and airport B flies to D. This graph would not show us the (longer) route of TSF -> B -> D -> A -> TSF, as it requires that _all_ airports fly to TSF.

[^2]: Actually saying they're slower than average is both true and not true - they _are_ significantly slower than most other libraries, but it's also because they're doing work that is significantly more complicated than most front end libraries normally do. I'm not saying Cytoscape isn't optimized (far from that, it's an amazing piece of code), it's just doing things that you would not normally do in JavaScript.
