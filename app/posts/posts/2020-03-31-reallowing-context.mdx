A disappointing trend I've seen recently has been for sites disabling context actions like copy, paste, select, or right click on their websites. Banks are notoriously bad at this - for some reason, they think it's a "security feature" to not let you paste in your account number, instead requiring you to manually type it in.

I realized it should be fairly easy to set up some global event listeners in the page and prevent the overridden behavior.

```js
/**
 * Stops propagation of an event to other event listeners, while still allowing the event to complete in its native
 * context
 * @param {string} type - the event type, i.e. 'paste', 'keyup', etc
 */
function stopPropagationOfType(type) {
  window.addEventListener(
    type,
    function (event) {
      event.stopPropagation();
    },
    true,
  );
}
```

If you inject this into the page with `stopPropagationOfType('paste');`, it will prevent any paste event listeners from running (which probably call `e.preventDefault()`.

I created a [chrome extension called PasteEnabler](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pasteenabler/dhadehfniifbmemochpmbofcjckpdnnl) that you can use that reenables the following features:

- Ability to paste content
- Ability to copy content
- Ability to cut content
- Ability to right click content
- Ability to autocomplete certain inputs
- Ability to select text
- Ability to drag and drop text to/from inputs

The code is fairly straightforward, and has worked on every site I've tried.

```js
/**
 * Function invoked on every load of the script
 */
function checkCopyAndPaste() {
  // enables paste on all items
  stopPropagationOfType("paste");
  // enables copying any inputs or text
  stopPropagationOfType("copy");
  // enables cutting text from an input
  stopPropagationOfType("cut");
  // enables drag + drop of text into input
  stopPropagationOfType("drop");
  // Enables autocomplete on all elements that have it
  const autocompleteDisabled = document.querySelectorAll("[autocomplete]");
  for (const elem of autocompleteDisabled) {
    elem.setAttribute("autocomplete", "on");
  }

  // enables right click context menu
  stopPropagationOfType("contextmenu");

  // Finds all elements and adds the user-select CSS property as text
  // note - this is a *little* hacky, but it's the only way I've found to get it to work, since user-select is not
  // inherited
  const elements = document.body.getElementsByTagName("*");
  if (elements.length) {
    for (const elem of elements) {
      addStyle(elem, "user-select", "text", true);
    }
  }

  // enables text selection
  stopPropagationOfType("selectstart");
  // Enables dragging on all elements that have it
  const draggableDisabled = document.querySelectorAll("[draggable]");
  for (const elem of draggableDisabled) {
    elem.setAttribute("draggable", "auto");
  }
}

/**
 * Adds the given CSS property and value to a DOM element.
 * @param {HTMLElement} element - element we are adding the CSS property to
 * @param {string} property - CSS property name, accepts hyphenated form (i.e. user-select rather than userSelect)
 * @param {string} value - CSS property value
 * @param {boolean} important - whether to add !important
 */
function addStyle(element, property, value, important) {
  //remove previously defined property
  if (element.style.setProperty) {
    element.style.setProperty(property, "");
  } else {
    element.style.setAttribute(property, "");
  }

  //insert the new style with all the old rules
  element.setAttribute("style", element.style.cssText + property + ":" + value + (important ? " !important" : "") + ";");
}
```
