I've been writing articles for Medium, Hackernoon, and freeCodeCamp for a while now, and enjoy the experience of creating content that is meant to be instructional or unbiased. However, I also have a few drafts for articles that I consider too opinionated or biased to publish under a <\quote> professional <\unquote> guise. This blog will serve as a repository of loosely edited, stream-of-consciousness type posts in which I still hope to write interesting things, just without the pretense of education, instruction, or objective points of view. 

These will be served under my name only, and not be affiliated with any company, publication, or organization.
