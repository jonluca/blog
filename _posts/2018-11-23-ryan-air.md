Ryanair is a wonderful example of two extremes - it's one of the worst possible airlines that nickel and dimes you for everything, [it's not a great employer](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/ryanair-strike-pilots-uk-ireland-flights-cancelled-why-latest-a8454161.html), and it is rated [the worst European airline](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/worst-airline-which-ryanair-british-airways-survey-vueling-jet2-norwegian-united-singapore-airlines-a8113616.html); however, it's **dirt** cheap.

Some friends and I wanted to take a trip out of Venice right before Christmas. We did not want to do a single round trip, though - we wanted to do a multi leg journey. The problem with Ryanair's site, though, is that it only lets you make a single round trip itinerary. This is great for round trip flights to a single destination, but means that it's a significant amount of work to cross reference which city goes where. If my flight plan is Airport A -> Airport B -> Airport C -> Airport A there's no way to check that B -> C -> A is a valid journey without checking *both* the B -> C segment and the C -> segment.

For instance, our first thought was to go to Berlin. Great - Ryanair has a nonstop from Venice Treviso to Berlin Schönefeld. If we want to add another leg of the trip, which *then* proceeds to return to Venice Treviso, we'd need to manually go through each of the airports that Berlin flies to and see if *that* airport flew to Venice.

We could model the relationship between airports as a graph, and then look for a cycle in the graph of size 3, with two nodes we already know.

The first step was to actually get the data from their site.

## Inspecting their site

I was hoping for an `XHR` request that retrieved a full list of airports in JSON format. Unfortunately I wasn't that lucky, but I got close enough. The HTML contained a log of `ng-` attributes, so I knew it was an angular app. Angular will store all variables in the state of a node, so I could just extract it from there.

The front end clearly did some sort of filtering - if you selected a departure airport it would only show you available destinations. I thought I could just find the node's state and extract it from there.

<p class="footnote">Ryanair only shows you available destinations from your airport of choice</p>

Weirdly enough most of my Angular debugging extensions did not work - they all said that the application was not an Angular app (if you know why, or if you knew they're using a weird Angular module, [let me know!](mailto:jonlucadecaro96@gmail.com)). I started poking through devtools, trying to figure out if they had somehow renamed the `ng` or `angular` instance. It was there but it still did not behave like an Angular app. They were using Angular 1.6.10, which is a fairly recent release, so I was perplexed. However, in the HTML for the destination picker there was a normal `ng-repeat` that iterated over a local variable coreList.

<img src="/images/ryanair-filtered-html.png">
<p class="footnote">There was a coreList state variable</p>

I traversed down the state tree until I found the `allAirportsList` property, which contained all the airport keys and the locations to which they flew. I extracted this state (over 1MB of route information) and could now build a graph representation of airport connections.

## Building out a graph model

First I had to store the information in a method that would be easily parsed and converted into a graph. The easiest would be to just have a map in which every key (an airport IATA code) was a set of all the airports that it could fly to.

```js
  let mappings = {};
  let airportCodes = [];
  for (const airport of airports.allAirportsList) {
    let id = airport.id; //format airport:XYZ
    let ryanairId = id.split(":");
    if (ryanairId[0] === "airport") {
      let iata = ryanairId[1];
      airportCodes.push(iata);
      if (!mappings.hasOwnProperty(iata)) {
        mappings[iata] = new Set();
      }
      let routes = airport.routes.filter(entry => {
        return entry.startsWith('airport');
      });

      routes = routes.map(entry => entry.split(":")[1]); // Format airport:XYZ
      routes = routes.map(entry => entry.split("|")[0]); // Some airports have format airport:XYZ|XYZ City
      for (const route of routes) {
        mappings[iata].add(route);
      }
    }
  }
```

I'm not sure if this is a bidirectional graph - I don't know if Airport A flying to Airport B means that Airport B also flies to Airport A. For now I'll keep this as a directed graph. 

I decided to use [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/) to visualize the results, as I'd used the library before. This visualization will help in the final graph, as it will show all the valid airports.

<p class="caption">

</p>

<div class="ryanair-graph blacked-background" id="all-airports"></div>

We could now visualize a graph of every airport and it's destinations. This was significantly more than I was expecting - the graph is almost unusable there are so many connections (there are 4223 edges!). We'd need to filter this more to remove all airports that did not satisfy our conditions.

<div class="ryanair-graph blacked-background" id="only-ber-connections"></div>

This is a graph that only shows outgoing connections from `SXF`, Berlin Schönefeld. However, this shows us destinations that might not connect to `TSF`.

We want a list of potential cities that A) Are reachable from Berlin and B) Will fly to `TSF`, Venice Treviso. 

We can just check each of the airports in the above graph and cross reference it with our original `mappings` - if `TSF` is not in the mapping, then we can remove it and all it's edges from the graph.

<div class="ryanair-graph blacked-background" id="only-valid-connections"></div>

And there we have our graph! All valid connections that go `TSF -> SXF -> ??? -> TSF`.

The best part of this is that *all* the above airports fly to `TSF` - we can add many more airports to our trip this way. We know that any path in the graph above lets us return to `TSF`, which means we can do a trip with `N` many distinct stops, where N is the length of the longest non repeating path[^1]!

We can also run a Depth First Search from SXF to compute the full path to every node.

## Deciding on cities

The graphs above are a cool visual representation but our end goal is really just a list of possible voyages - something like `TSF -> SXF -> MLA -> TSF`. The full list is here:

<ul>
	<li>AGP - Malaga, Spain</li>
	<li>BRI - Bari, Italy</li>
	<li>BRU - Brussels, Belgium</li>
	<li>BUD - Budapest, Hungary</li>
	<li>CGN - Cologne, Germany</li>
	<li>CTA - Catania, Italy</li>
	<li>DUB - Dublin, Ireland</li>
	<li>EDI - Edinburgh, United Kingdom</li>
	<li>EMA - East Midlands, United Kingdom</li>
	<li>KRK - Krakow, Poland</li>
	<li>LPA - Gran Canaria, Spain</li>
	<li>MAN - Manchester, United Kingdom</li>
	<li>MLA - Malta, Malta</li>
	<li>OPO - Porto, Portugal</li>
	<li>PMO - Palermo, Italy</li>
	<li>RAK - Marrakesh, Morocco</li>
	<li>SOF - Sofia, Bulgaria</li>
	<li>STN - London Stansted, United Kingdom</li>
	<li>SVQ - Seville, Spain</li>
	<li>SXF - Berlin Schönefeld, Germany</li>
	<li>TFS - Tenerife South, Spain</li>
	<li>VLC - Valencia, Spain</li>
	<li>VNO - Vilnius, Lithuania</li>
</ul>

## Cycles, NP-Complete-ness, and arbitrary airports

I thought it would be fun to see if we could actually find a Hamiltonian Cycle in the graph. Unfortunately, with 242 airports and over 4000 routes this would be nearly impossible to compute. It's actually not that bad to find it in the final graph below, though - although it *is* NP-Complete, when a graph is as connected with as many edges as above it's actually not that difficult to find. 
 
 I also wrote the tool below to compute cycles up to 4 airports in length, starting and ending from a set airport.

## Conclusion

This was the first time I've used a graph algorithm in a non-academic context, which is pretty cool. It was a fun endeavour that created a tool that will hopefully be useful to some. If you're looking to plan a super cheap European vacation you can just use this to add all the legs of your Ryanair flights!

A nice future addition would be to somehow get price data for each flight plan. I found their API and it's pretty straight forward:

```bash
curl 'https://api.ryanair.com/farefinder/3/oneWayFares?&departureAirportIataCode=TSF&language=en&limit=16&market=en-gb&offset=0&outboundDepartureDateFrom=2018-10-04&outboundDepartureDateTo=2019-10-26&priceValueTo=150'
```

I might get to that if I find that our N-length trip gets too expensive.

Also I apologize if this webpage was slow or clunky - normally I'm a [huge fan of web optimizations](https://hackernoon.com/optimizing-a-static-site-d5ab6899f249), but this blog post needed libraries that are significantly slower than average to show what I wanted to show[^2].

###### Footnotes

[^1]: This graph is actually a more limited version of the problem - since every airport flies to TSF, we are artificially limiting the number of routes. Let's say that A, B, and C are in the graph that fly to TSF. Airport D does not fly to TSF, but it does fly to airport A, and airport B flies to D. This graph would not show us the (longer) route of TSF -> B -> D -> A -> TSF, as it requires that *all* airports fly to TSF.

[^2]: Actually saying they're slower than average is both true and not true - they *are* significantly slower than most other libraries, but it's also because they're doing work that is significantly more complicated than most front end work. I'm not saying Cytoscape isn't optimized (far from that, it's an amazing piece of code), it's just doing things that you would not normally do in JavaScript.
