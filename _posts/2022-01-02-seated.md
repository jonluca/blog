Last month I [wrote about writing a bot to automatically get reservations for OpenTable](/posts/opentable?ref=seated). In that same vein, Seated is an app that offers a certain (sizable) percentage off your bill for certain restaurants in your area.

{% include image.html file="seated" alt="Seated screenshot" footnote="Screenshot from Seated app of a block in the LES in NYC" style="max-width:80%;"%}

The rebates actually get pretty substantial - up to 50% in some cases. Half off dinner in NYC is a pretty enticing proposition (although most of the restaurants seem to be in the 10 - 20% range).

It's a pretty interesting app - I'm not entirely sure what their business model is (as I can't image that a known low-margin industry like restaurants would be able to rebate 50% of the total value of  a bill), but it does work and their rebates are easy to claim.

I wanted to see if I could grab all their restaurants and visualize the stats on them.

## Finding their API

I used the same methodology as in the previous article - luckily, the app didn't do any form of TLS pinning, and I was able to quickly reverse their routes.

{% include image.html file="seated-api" alt="Seated API"%}

I then converted it to Python using a handy [curl converter](https://curlconverter.com/).


```py
import requests

headers = {
    'Host': 'api.seatedapp.io',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Flavor': 'native_app_v1',
    'Accept': '*/*',
    'Authorization': f"Bearer {os.environ.get('BEARER_TOKEN')}",
    'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
    'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate',
    'Platform': 'ios',
    'User-Agent': 'Seated/1075 CFNetwork/1327.0.4 Darwin/21.2.0',
    'Device': '?unrecognized?',
    'Build': '1075',
}

params = (
    ('city', '2'),
    ('isRemoveFutureWalkInVariant', 'false'),
    ('latitude', '40.71'),
    ('longitude', '-73.98'),
    ('mapLatitude', '40.71'),
    ('mapLongitude', '-73.99'),
    ('maxSeats', '2'),
    ('minSeats', '2'),
    ('page', '1'),
    ('size', '50'),
    ('slotForDate', '2022-01-02T18:30:00.000Z'),
)

response = requests.get('https://api.seatedapp.io/v2/search/map/dinein', headers=headers, params=params, verify=False)

```

I then adapted this to save all the restaurants for later processing, and played around with the size of the response (it seemed to error out on values above 400).

```py
import requests
import json
import os

headers = {
  'Host': 'api.seatedapp.io',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Flavor': 'native_app_v1',
  'Accept': '*/*',
  'Authorization': f"Bearer {os.environ.get('BEARER_TOKEN')}",
  'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9',
  'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate',
  'Platform': 'ios',
  'User-Agent': 'Seated/1075 CFNetwork/1327.0.4 Darwin/21.2.0',
  'Device': '?unrecognized?',
  'Build': '1075',
}


def get_params_from_page(page=1):
  return (
    ('city', '2'),
    ('isRemoveFutureWalkInVariant', 'false'),
    ('latitude', '40.71'),
    ('longitude', '-73.98'),
    ('mapLatitude', '40.71'),
    ('mapLongitude', '-73.99'),
    ('maxSeats', '2'),
    ('minSeats', '2'),
    ('page', str(page)),
    ('size', '400'),
    ('slotForDate', '2022-01-02T18:30:00.000Z'),
  )


restaurants = []
page = 1
while True:
  params = get_params_from_page(page)
  response = requests.get('https://api.seatedapp.io/v2/search/map/dinein', headers=headers, params=params)
  data = response.json()
  if 'restaurants' in data:
    restaurants += data['restaurants']
  else:
    print("Something went wrong")
  if 'metaData' in data and not data['metaData']['hasMoreItems']:
    break
  print(f"Completed page {str(page)}")
  page += 1

print(f"Found {len(restaurants)} restaurants")
with open('restaurants.json', 'w') as out:
  out.write(json.dumps(restaurants))
  out.close()
```


Each restaurant entry had the following shape:

## Rewards

Once I had all the data, I wanted to see where most restaurants fell, in terms of their max reward distribution.

<style>
.rwd-table {
  margin: 1em 0;
  min-width: 300px;
}
.rwd-table tr {
  border-top: 1px solid #ddd;
  border-bottom: 1px solid #ddd;
  border:  1px solid black;
}
.rwd-table th {
  display: none;
}
.rwd-table td {
  display: block;
}
.rwd-table td:first-child {
  padding-top: .5em;
}
.rwd-table td:last-child {
  padding-bottom: .5em;
}
.rwd-table td:before {
  content: attr(data-th) ": ";
  font-weight: bold;

  display: inline-block;
}
@media (min-width: 480px) {
  .rwd-table td:before {
    display: none;
  }
}
.rwd-table th, .rwd-table td {
  text-align: left;

@media (min-width: 480px) {
  .rwd-table th, .rwd-table td {

  }
  .rwd-table th:last-child, .rwd-table td:last-child {
    padding-right: 0;
  }
}

.rwd-table {

.rwd-table tr {

.rwd-table th, .rwd-table td {

.rwd-table th, .rwd-table td:before {

@media (min-width: 480px) {
  .rwd-table th, .rwd-table td {

{:.rwd-table}

Most restaurants fall in the 10-15% back, and only a handful are above 35%. I expected a more normal distribution, and fewer restaurants offering 20%+, but it's a pretty healthy range and they're clustered in a relatively high return zone.

## Visualizing locations

I also wanted to see where all their restaurants were - I didn't necessarily want to travel to Yonkers for 30% off a pizza.

{% include image.html file="seated-map" alt="Map of all seated's restaurants"%}

This worked very well - it was trivial to then cut the dataframe to only restaurants in downtown NYC:

```py
les_df = geo_df[geo_df['latitude'].between(40.7,40.767645)]
les_df[['name',reward]].head(10)
```

{% include image.html file="seated-downtown-head" alt="Downtown restaurants with highest rebates"%}

## Rating vs Reward

What's interesting is that every restaurant also has a yelp rating. I wondered if the rating was correlated to the rebate size - were worse restaurants offering more (if it was even the restaurant's choice on the max reward %?) due to low rewards?

{% include image.html file="seated-rating-vs-reward" alt="Reward vs Yelp rating"%}

And the answer is... kinda? There highest rewards show up at the 3 and 4 star ratings, but they also have the highest distribution of restaurants, so with more data points you're more likely to have outliers.

{% include image.html file="seated-rating-stats" alt="Yelp rating mean stats"%}

The above shows the stats for the reward based on the yelp rating. If we assume that 1, 2 and 5 star ratings are low-volume outliers, we see a *slight* correlation, but not enough to draw any conclusions from.

## Reward vs Price

Another interesting potential correlation is with the maximum rebate % and how expensive the restaurant is - you'd imagine that nicer restaurants would offer less back.

{% include image.html file="seated-price-vs-reward" alt="Reward vs Price"%}

This is somewhat observed, although there are some 4 dollar sign restaurants that offer 30% back.
