Zogo is a finanical education app that offers incentives to its users, through gift cards, for completing its "modules". These incentives take the form of gift cards, and include Amazon, Apple, and other gift cards that are pretty much as good as cash. 
You earn pineapples by participating in the app through various quizzes, and once you have 5000 pineapples, you can redeem a $5 gift card.

## Firing up burp suite

I used burp suite and set up the local proxy, hoping that the app wasn't using TLS stapling. There's a great jailbroken library called [SSL Kill Switch 2](https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/ssl-kill-switch2) that will bypass the native TLS stapling API on ios devices, but my current iPhone isn't jailbroken. 

I was hopeful, though, because Zogo is still a small start up and probably hasn't made network security a top priority.
