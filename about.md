Hi! I'm JonLuca DeCaro. Starting in January I'll be a Software Engineering Intern at Elevate Security, in Berkeley. This fall I was a Software Engineering Intern at Google. Before that I was a Security Engineer at Apple.

I enjoy blogging about tech, programming, and security. 

I also write for HackerNoon and freeCodeCamp on Medium, [here](https://medium.com/@jonluca).
