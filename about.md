Hi! 

I'm <a href="https://twitter.com/jonluca"><b>JonLuca DeCaro</b></a>. I grew up in north east Italy, and moved to the United States in 2014 to study in Los Angeles. I'm currently a Growth Engineer in San Francisco, CA at Pinterest.

Previously I worked at Google, Apple, and Elevate Security. I currently do free lance growth consulting and development work under JonLuca DeCaro Consulting.

## New here?

I recommend starting with the following three posts. They all focus on tech and explorations of topics I find interesting.

1. [Illegal streams, decrypting m3u8's, and building a better stream experience](https://blog.jldc.me/posts/illegal-streams?ref=about) - An article on exploring illegal sports streams online, building a client to watch them, and seeing how the streamers are piggybacking real services.

2. [Obfuscated javascript, scam emails, and American Express](https://blog.jldc.me/posts/deobfuscating-amex-scammer?ref=about) - An article on reversing and decompiling obfuscated javascript, tracking spam emails, and finding the root command and control server for a scam campaign.

3. [Ryanair, Hamiltonian Cycles, and using graph theory to find cheap flights](https://blog.jldc.me/posts/ryan-air?ref=about) - An article on how I routed my European vacation, writing an NP hard problem solver, and releasing a tool to help you do the same.

I also write for HackerNoon and freeCodeCamp on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonluca).

## What am I reading?

Here are a few blogs or places on the internet that I enjoy reading. I don't agree with everything on all of them, so don't take it as an endorsement of the site as a whole, but each one has at least one thing worth considering and thinking about.

I also maintain a running list of interesting snippets of text in my [Interesting Snippets repo.](https://github.com/jonluca/interesting-snippets)

## Beliefs

These are a few beliefs that are snapshots of a shifting, growing ideology and are by no means static.

* I consider myself a rationalist with a strong emphasis on personal responsibility

* I believe [collective action](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/collective-responsibility/) problems to be some of the most nuanced and interesting issues facing humanity in the early 21st century. 

* There has probably never been an accurate valuation of institutional knowledge within any organization or group

* [Performance matters, especially when you have the resources to improve it](https://medium.com/hackernoon/optimizing-a-static-site-d5ab6899f249)

* Intuition and anecdotes are so harmful to a good debate that it's worth the extra cognitive load to actively discuss the inherent bias our experience brings to objective discussions

* [Words per minute is not a good measure of typing speed](https://blog.jldc.me/posts/wpm)

* [Tracking changes, differentation, and growth are inherently interesting, and why I use git to save all the changes to this blog](https://github.com/jonluca/blog)

* Pineapple shouldn't be on pizza, but it's also not *that* bad

## Photos

I'm a strong believer in attaching your real identity to your ideologies and thoughts. Few things are as personally identifiable as photos, and as the old adage goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, so here's a bit about me.

### Donations

I've been asked about payment for my software, or donations. I'm in no need for money, and I release my code and projects for free because I want to contribute back to the ecosystem that helped me succeed. If you really are inclined to support my projects, [please consider donating to the EFF](https://supporters.eff.org/donate/).
