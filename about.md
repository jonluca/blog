Hi! I'm JonLuca DeCaro. I'm currently a Software Engineering Intern at Google. Before this I was a Security Engineer at Apple.

I enjoy blogging about tech, programming, and security. 

This is a collection of articles or thoughts that are more personal and opinionated and less objective than my publicized articles (in journals or publications not under my own name).

I also write for HackerNoon and freeCodeCamp on Medium, [here](https://medium.com/@jonluca).
