Privacy Policy for Palate

Last updated: 1/12/2026

Palate (“Palate,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is an iOS application designed to operate fully on-device. Your privacy is a core design principle. This Privacy Policy explains what data we do and do not collect, how it is used, and your rights.

1. Overview

Palate is a fully local, on-device application. All core functionality runs entirely on your device. We do not require accounts, do not upload your photos or content to our servers, and do not sell or share personal data.

2. Data We Do Not Collect

Palate does not collect, store, or transmit:

Photos, videos, or media from your device

Location data or precise GPS coordinates

Contacts, calendars, messages, or call data

User-generated content or metadata derived from it

Personally identifiable information (PII) such as name, email, phone number, or address

Payment or financial information

Advertising identifiers for ad targeting

All analysis and processing remain on your device.

3. On-Device Processing

Any analysis performed by Palate (including image recognition, classification, or organization) happens entirely on your device using local system APIs and models. No media or analysis results are transmitted off the device.

4. Telemetry & Diagnostics (Optional)

To improve app stability and performance, Palate may collect limited, anonymized telemetry, which can include:

App launch and crash reports

Performance metrics (e.g., feature usage frequency, latency)

Device information such as iOS version, app version, and hardware model

Important:

Telemetry data is not linked to your identity

Telemetry does not include photos, content, or personal data

Telemetry collection may be optional and configurable via system or in-app settings

We do not use telemetry for advertising or tracking across apps

We may use Apple-provided services (such as App Store or system diagnostics) to collect this information.

5. Third-Party Services

Palate does not integrate third-party SDKs for advertising, analytics, or tracking that collect personal data.

If system-level Apple services are used (e.g., crash reporting), they are governed by Apple’s Privacy Policy.

6. Data Retention

Because Palate does not collect personal data or user content, there is no personal data retention on our servers.

Any locally stored data remains on your device and is deleted when you delete the app.

7. Children’s Privacy

Palate does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13. Because the app operates locally and does not collect personal data, no special data handling is required.

8. Your Rights

Since Palate does not collect or store personal data, there is no data to access, export, or delete from our servers. You remain in full control of your data on your device at all times.

9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
