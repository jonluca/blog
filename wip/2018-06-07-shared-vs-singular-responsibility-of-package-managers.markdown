At [JSConf EU 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA), day Ryan Dahl (the original creator of Node.js) went over his regrets when designing the language, and introduced [Deno](https://github.com/ry/deno), a TypeScript runtime built around V8. One of his regrets was how Node's package system was designed, and a few issues that arose from it. From the trite (Not appending `.ts` or `.js` to imports) to deeper, harder to fix issues (Singular control and point of failure with the NPM registry).

I wanted to expand on his points and genericize it across platforms and dive into how every language or framework does it - from *nix's `apt` to Rust's `crates` to PHP's `composer`.

# Overview 

To start we have to actually define what a package manager actually *is* - what exactly does a modern package manager provide?

* Remote package installation

* Dependency management

* Version management 

# History

# Most common failures

# Doing things "right"
